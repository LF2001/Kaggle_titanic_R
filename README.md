Exploring the kaggle titanic dataset using R

Here I explore the Titanic dataset using the caret package in R. 

There are four parts to the analysis: 
(1) Missing value imputation
(2) Feature engineering
(3) Basic data exploration
(4) Model building 

Model building:
- GLM
- k-means clustering
- linear discriminant analysis versus quadratic discriminant analysis
- random forests

The R-markdown document has been knitted as an .html file. It can be opened in a browser and contains the code and output of the script.
